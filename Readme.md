## Installation

1. Clone or download the project files from the repository.
2. Open MySQL Database and create a database named `ams_db`.
3. Initialize the React and Node repositories by running the command in each directory.

```shell
npm install
```

4. Initialize the React and Node servers by running the command in each directory.

```shell
npm start
```

5. For backend server you should see a message indicating that nodemon is running..
6. The frontend development server would be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`.
