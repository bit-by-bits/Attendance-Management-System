# Attendance Management System - Frontend

The frontend of the Attendance Management System is built using React and related libraries. It handles the data from the API endpoints, provides user-friendly interfaces for viewing and updating the data, and performs the necessary operations for managing attendance records.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MySQL Server

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project files from the repository.

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the project's root directory:

```shell
npm install
```

3. Set up AMS Backend and connect to the SQL database.

4. Start the frontend developement server by running the following command:
